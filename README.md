If you are like me, you have grown accustomed to "reverse" or "natural" scrolling from use of it on iOS, macOS, or Android. Windows 10 now includes the option for in the Windows Precision Trackpad driver. To date Lenovo has not offered the same option in it's Thinkpoint driver.

This script should work to reverse the scrolling direction on other input devices as well, not just Thinkpoints.
